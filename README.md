# MERN TypeScript note-taking application

The intent of this project is for me to learn TypeScript and gain experience with React.js as well as the MERN stack. I also wanted to reproduce my own version of Evernote's note-taking application, but make it free like it used to be.

## To install all packages, run

`npm install`

## To run server:

-> Run `npm install` then `cd backend` then type `nodemon server.ts` _or_ `npx nodemon server.ts`

## To run client:

-> Run `npm install` then `cd frontend` then `npm run dev`
